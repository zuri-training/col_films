## Introduction

The goal assigned to my team was to develop a streaming service specifically for university students.

According to the [documentation](https://www.figma.com/file/YMpV4L3A6gMc1yDITmKcmu/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=p6X0S0kmGhd4c4ds-0), we understand we are building a site where only students may publish movies with a maximum runtime of 15 minutes. Authenticated users can view as many videos as they like and engage in social activities.  

But unauthenticated individuals (unregistered) can only explore a short selection of films before being asked to sign up (likes, comments, etc). Videos may also be bookmarked and downloaded by authenticated users.

We also determined that the service we are developing will only be available to "participating universities in Nigeria"; as we move further along the pipeline, we want to grow it.


## The Design Team

The designers in the team conducted user-qualitative and quantitative research in order to fully comprehend the needs, pain points, and expectations of the majority of users of content management systems. In order to get the best use case for the platform, the design team followed the design process in the order below:

1.  Empathy Mapping 
2.  Pain Points identification
3.  Idea Prioritization Matrix
4.  Brainstorming and Ideation
5.  User Personas creation
6.  Creating the user stories
7.  Final Product Feature selection for MVP
8.  Creation of user flows
9.  User Surveys and research
10. Prototyping

The design team chose figma because of its collaborative nature,making it easy for all designers to work together,make corrections, comment and track the status of the project.figjam is also similar to figma, it makes the design process easy for designers
