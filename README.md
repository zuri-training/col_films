## Introduction

The goal assigned to my team was to develop a streaming service specifically for university students.

According to the documentation, we understand we are building a site where only students may publish movies with a maximum runtime of 15 minutes. Authenticated users can view as many videos as they like and engage in social activities.  

But unauthenticated individuals (unregistered) can only explore a short selection of films before being asked to sign up (likes, comments, etc). Videos may also be bookmarked and downloaded by authenticated users.

We also determined that the service we are developing will only be available to "participating universities in Nigeria"; as we move further along the pipeline, we want to grow it.


## THE DESIGN TEAM

The designers in the team conducted user-qualitative and quantitative research in order to fully comprehend the needs, pain points, and expectations of the majority of users of content management systems. In order to get the best use case for the platform, the design team followed the design process in the order below:

Empathy Mapping 
Pain Points identification
Idea Prioritization Matrix
Brainstorming and Ideation
User Personas creation
Creating the user stories
Final Product Feature selection for MVP
Creation of user flows
User Surveys and research
Prototyping
